IU Art Musuem
If you have error of App.Theme.Light click the project folder of IUArtMuseum, click on project then properties. Go to android, check is library and add 
appcompatv7. 

This may have some other errors as I was unable to test on a Virtual Device, I just wanted to get GitHub working from my computer.
